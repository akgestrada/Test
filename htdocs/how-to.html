                <p>Availability and Pricing can vary in different countries/regions.</p>

                        <h3>Pricing can vary</h3>
                        <p>Pricing in your country may be different. In the Philippines, the price of IPhone 14 Pro Max is ~Php 78000 while in Indonesia, the price is ~Php 83000.</p>

                <h2>Reviews!</h2>
                <p>Reviews are very important to check if there are any hidden problems.</p>
                <div class="step-container">
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Fake Reviews</h3>
                        <p>Try to wait for trusted reviewers like MKBHD, MrWhosetheBoss, or LinusTechTips to release a FULL review. Companies stop reviewers from releasing early reviews because a bad one will hurt their sales. Sometimes, companies limit what the reviewer can talk about the device, which is abused by only allowing them to say good things about it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Sets Expectations</h3>
                        <p>There are some things you can't identify just by looking at the spec sheet. Phone cameras now are so good the only noticable thing that seperates them apart are people's personal preference (most flagship phones). Another example is the SnapDragon 8 Gen 1. Although it is a fast chip, it gets hot.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Watch reviews for each step!</h3>
                        <p>To properly identify what best fits your preferences/the list of recommendations, we recommend you to watch reviews for each and every step.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h2>Budget</h2>
                <p>How much are you willing to spend?</p>
                <div class="step-container">
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Be honest to yourself.</h3>
                        <p>Do you actually need the best phone with the best camera and best performance? If your just going to use it for watching content or other simple things, do you really need the best phone?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>IPhone Pricing</h3>
                        <p>The cheapest IPhone in 2022 that we recommend is IPhone 12 Mini (Used - Php 20,000) and IPhone 12 (Used - 25,000). It is hard to recommend IPhone X because software update support will end very soon, if it hasn't already.</p>

                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>It all comes down to preference.</h3>
                        <p>They both have their advantages and disadvantages. If you can make use of Apple's ecosystem, go for IOS. If you like using apks to avoid paying for services, go for android.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Performance</h3>
                        <p>Do you play a lot of power hungry games like Genshin or are you a casual Candy Crush enjoyer?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Genshin - IPhones</h3>
                        <p>We recommend the IPhone 11 or later, but if you want to enjoy the best performance with the highest settings, you should consider using a fan/phone cooler. If you want the best IPhone for gaming, consider getting one of the IPhone 14 Pros.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Genshin - Android</h3>
                        <p>a little more complicated</p>
                            <h4>Chipset</h4>
                            <P class="morepara">The minimum that we recommend is the Snapdragon 845 (30 fps, medium settings) but ideally, you should get the Snapdragon 888 (high settings, 60 fps) with 8 gigabytes of ram. </P>
                            <h4>Cooling</h4>
                            <P class="morepara">ALWAYS check reviews first before buying because even if the smartphone has the best chipset, if the cooling is bad, you will experience throttling and the chipset won't get the performance it should. Chipsets should be cooled properly to achieve peak performance. Consider using a phone cooler/fan to get the best performance possible, but it may not be enough if internal cooling is the problem.</P>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Candy Crush</h3>
                    <p>This should not be a problem unless you are buying a very old phone (10 years ago). Even Php 5000 phones can do it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Reviews!</h3>
                    <p>There are videos online showing just how much performance a specific phone can get. To avoid fake reviews, try watching multiple videos and comparing the results.</p>

                    <h3>Preference</h3>
                    <p>What kind of photos do you like? Do you like a more colorful one? Will you use an external program to change the colors so you only need a better quality?</p>

                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Reviews!</h3>
                        <p>Always check reviews. 100 megapixels mean nothing if the image processing is bad. The IPhone 13 only has 12 megapixels but the quality is still one of the best!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Camera Software Updates</h3>
                        <p>Some companies like Samsung have camera updates, so if you don't like the photos that it takes now, there is a chance of it being replaced, unlike Apple. If you like how your IPhone takes photos, then there shouldn't be any problems.</p>

                        <h3>Watching Content</h3>
                        <p>Good speakers are a game changer when watching content. If you don't need it, then atleast get something decent.</p>

                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Headphone Jack</h3>
                        <p>We almost exclusively use wireless earphones but if you need it, check the spec sheet. If you are using high quality headphones/earphones, try watching reviews to see if the audio jack is good enough that you can actually make use of the headphones' features.</p>

                        <h3>Reviews!</h3>
                        <p>The battery life shown on spec sheets are almost always not true, but there are many videos online about battery tests.</p>

                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Display Type</h3>
                        <p>What are the things that you will primary do with your phone? This determines what display type (OLED, Retina, AMOLED, etc) you should get. If you like watching content, playing games, or working(reading emails), then you would benefit from a larger screen. If you use your phone in bright environments, get a brighter screen.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Resolution</h3>
                        <p>Higher resolution means better sharpness. This doesn't exactly mean better at everything because it also depends on your preference and the human eyes can only see so much from a normal distance. Higher resolution means higher battery consumption.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <h3>Refresh Rate</h3>
                        <p>30 fps and 60 fps is a big jump, but 60 to 120? Not so much. If you don't play games competitively, you most likely can't see enough difference between a 120hz and 60hz refresh rate. Another thing to consider is that most videos and movies are filmed at 60fps.</p>
